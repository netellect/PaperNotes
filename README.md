Usage
-----
Run PNotes.exe to start the program. It adds an icon in the system tray (next to the
clock).
To open the Main Menu - right-click the Paper Notes Icon in the system tray.
To Add a blank note - double-click the Icon in the system tray, or select New from
the main menu.
To Display notes - click once the Icon in the system tray.
To change Note Properties - right-click the note title area to display the note menu.
To Hide (not delete) a note - click the [x] symbol on the top right corner of the note.
To Delete a note - right-click the note title area and select Delete.

To Close the program - select Exit in the Main Menu. It will also save its data.

To Move a note - click and drag the note by its title area.
To Resize a note - click and drag the note border. You can also bring all notes to the
same size by selecting Default Size All from the main menu.

There are also extended properties that you can change - they affect all notes. You
can find them in the main menu under the Options... item.


The notes are really "sticky". They glue to each other and the screen border, if
moved sufficiently close to them.
